## Netlify Deployment Fix

The website at [https://bitbybit01.netlify.app/](https://bitbybit01.netlify.app/) was not working due to missing configuration files and environment variables. Here's how to fix it:

### ✅ Fixed Issues

1. **Added Netlify Configuration Files:**
   - `netlify.toml` - Build and redirect configuration
   - `public/_redirects` - Client-side routing support

2. **Fixed Firebase Configuration:**
   - Added fallback values for missing environment variables
   - Added error handling to prevent app crashes

3. **Build Configuration:**
   - Specified Node.js version (18)
   - Set correct publish directory (`dist`)
   - Added proper redirects for SPA routing

### 🔧 Netlify Setup Instructions

#### Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)
1. **Deploy from Git:**
   - Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
   - Build settings are automatically detected from `netlify.toml`

#### Option 2: Manual Upload
1. **Build locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. **Upload `dist` folder** to Netlify manually

#### Option 3: Environment Variables (For Full Firebase Features)
If you want Firebase authentication and cloud sync:

1. **Go to Netlify Dashboard** → Site Settings → Environment Variables
2. **Add these variables:**
   ```
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
   ```

### 📝 Build Settings for Netlify

```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm run build"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
```

### 🌐 Domain Configuration

- **Current Domain:** bitbybit01.netlify.app
- **Custom Domain:** Can be configured in Netlify settings
- **HTTPS:** Automatically enabled by Netlify

### ✨ Features That Work Without Firebase

Even without Firebase environment variables, the app will work with:
- ✅ All 3113 LeetCode questions
- ✅ Progress tracking (localStorage)
- ✅ Topic and subtopic completion
- ✅ Individual question checkboxes
- ✅ Responsive design
- ❌ Cloud sync (requires Firebase setup)
- ❌ Cross-device progress (requires Firebase setup)

### 🔍 Troubleshooting

**If the site still doesn't work:**

1. **Check Build Logs** in Netlify dashboard
2. **Verify Node Version** is 18 or higher
3. **Check Console Errors** in browser developer tools
4. **Redeploy** after making changes

**Common Issues:**
- **404 on refresh:** Fixed by `_redirects` file
- **Firebase errors:** Fixed by fallback configuration
- **Build failures:** Check Node.js version and dependencies
